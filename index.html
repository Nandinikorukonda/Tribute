              Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, known as Mahatma Gandhi, was a preeminent leader 
              of India's independence movement against British rule. Born in 1869 in Porbandar,
               he advocated for nonviolent civil disobedience and inspired millions with his philosophy 
               of Satyagraha. Gandhi led various campaigns for civil rights and freedom, including the
                Salt March and Quit India Movement. His efforts culminated in India's independence in 1947,
                 but his legacy extends far beyond, influencing movements for civil rights and freedom worldwide.
                  He was assassinated in 1948, but his principles of nonviolence and peaceful resistance continue
                   to inspire generations.

              Subhash Chandra Bose, fondly known as Netaji, was a charismatic and dynamic leader in India's struggle for independence. He fervently opposed British rule and advocated for complete freedom through his Azad Hind Fauj (Indian National Army).
